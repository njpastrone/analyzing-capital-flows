WINSORIZATION METHODOLOGY DOCUMENTATION
========================================

Purpose:
This winsorization pipeline creates outlier-adjusted versions of all Capital Flows Research 
datasets to assess the sensitivity of statistical findings to extreme values.

Methodology:
- Symmetric winsorization at 5% level (default)
- Replaces values below 5th percentile with 5th percentile value
- Replaces values above 95th percentile with 95th percentile value
- Applied indicator-by-indicator to preserve variable-specific distributions
- Grouped by country-indicator pairs to maintain cross-sectional relationships

Technical Specifications:
- Winsorization Level: 5% from each tail (configurable)
- Missing Values: Excluded from percentile calculations, preserved as NA
- Temporal Structure: Maintained across all time periods
- Crisis Periods: Definitions unchanged from original data

Implementation Details:
- R Version: 4.0+
- Key Packages: tidyverse, readr
- Processing: Indicator-by-indicator within country groups
- Output Format: CSV files with '_winsorized' suffix

Quality Assurance:
- Sample sizes preserved across all datasets
- Statistical moments calculated for comparison
- Percentage of affected observations documented
- Temporal and cross-sectional structures validated
